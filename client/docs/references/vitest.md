# Getting Started [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#getting-started)

## Overview [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#overview)

Vitest (pronounced as _"veetest"_) is a next generation testing framework powered by Vite.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/why) section.

## Trying Vitest Online [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#trying-vitest-online)

You can try Vitest online on [StackBlitz](https://vitest.new/). It runs Vitest directly in the browser, and it is almost identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine.

## Adding Vitest to Your Project [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#adding-vitest-to-your-project)

TIP

Vitest requires Vite >=v6.4.0 and Node >=v22.12.0

It is recommended that you install a copy of `vitest` in your `package.json`, using one of the methods listed above. However, if you would prefer to run `vitest` directly, you can use `npx vitest` (the `npx` tool comes with npm and Node.js).

The `npx` tool will execute the specified command. By default, `npx` will first check if the command exists in the local project's binaries. If it is not found there, `npx` will look in the system's `$PATH` and execute it if found. If the command is not found in either location, `npx` will install it in a temporary location prior to execution.

Vitest and third party integrations can use `.vitest` directory to store generated artifacts. It's recommended to add this in your `.gitignore`.

.gitignore

```
# Vitest reports and artifacts
.vitest/
```

## Writing Tests [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#writing-tests)

As an example, we will write a simple test that verifies the output of a function that adds two numbers.

sum.js

```
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

sum.test.js

```
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { sum } from './sum.js'

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
```

TIP

By default, tests must contain `.test.` or `.spec.` in their file name.

Next, in order to execute the test, add the following section to your `package.json`:

package.json

json

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `npm run test`, `yarn test` or `pnpm test`, depending on your package manager, and Vitest will print this message:

txt

```
✓ sum.test.js (1)
  ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  1 passed (1)
  Start at  02:15:44
  Duration  311ms
```

WARNING

If you are using Bun as your package manager, make sure to use `bun run test` command instead of `bun test`, otherwise Bun will run its own test runner.

Your first test is passing! Continue to [Writing Tests](https://vitest.dev/guide/learn/writing-tests) to learn about organizing tests, reading test output, and the core testing patterns you'll use every day.

To run tests once without watching for file changes, use `vitest run`. You can also pass additional flags like `--reporter` or `--coverage`. For a full list of CLI options, run `npx vitest --help` or see the [CLI guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli).

## Configuring Vitest [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#configuring-vitest)

Vitest reads your `vite.config.*` by default, so your existing Vite plugins and configuration work out-of-the-box. You can also create a dedicated `vitest.config.*` for test-specific settings. See the [Config Reference](https://vitest.dev/config/) for details.

## IDE Integrations [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/#ide-integrations)

We also provided an official extension for Visual Studio Code to enhance your testing experience with Vitest.
